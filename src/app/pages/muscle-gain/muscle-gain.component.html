        Muscle is one of the most powerful indicators of long-term health, resilience, and longevity. Beyond aesthetics, lean muscle mass plays a critical role in metabolic function, hormone regulation, blood sugar control, joint stability, and immune strength. As we age, we naturally lose muscle through a process called sarcopenia—leading to frailty, slower metabolism, reduced mobility, and higher risk of chronic illness. Maintaining and building muscle helps protect against these effects, improves insulin sensitivity, supports weight loss, and enhances energy and functional independence. That’s why muscle gain isn’t just for athletes—it’s a foundational goal for anyone pursuing longevity and optimal health. At ABBSI, we incorporate strength training, recovery protocols, nutritional support, peptides, and hormone optimization to help you build and preserve the muscle that keeps you strong, vital, and thriving at any age.
