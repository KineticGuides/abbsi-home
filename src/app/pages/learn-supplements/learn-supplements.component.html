      <h5 class="subheading">Why Supplements Matter</h5>
      <p>Supplements help correct nutrient deficiencies, support key biological systems, and accelerate results when lifestyle alone isn’t enough. But quality and personalization are key. At ABBSI, we only recommend supplements based on lab results and clinical evidence.</p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Personalized Blends Based on Labs</h5>
      <p>We go beyond one-size-fits-all. Based on your blood work and wellness goals, we may create custom-compounded supplements—combining key ingredients into one capsule or powder to simplify your daily routine.</p>

    <!-- Integration -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Integrated Into Every Protocol</h5>
      <p>Supplements are used in conjunction with lifestyle, peptides, and sometimes medications—not in place of them. They're selected to enhance your program outcomes whether you're focused on weight loss, cognition, aging, or immune health.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!-- Safety & Supervision -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Clinically Guided & Safe</h5>
      <p>All supplements are prescribed or recommended under clinician supervision. We monitor for interactions, track symptom improvements, and adjust doses over time to make sure your protocol evolves with your progress.</p>
