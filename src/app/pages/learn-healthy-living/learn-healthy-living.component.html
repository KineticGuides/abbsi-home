    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Why Lifestyle Matters</h5>
      <p>More than 80% of chronic diseases are preventable through lifestyle changes. At ABBSI, we believe that sustainable habits—not short-term fixes—are the key to unlocking healthspan and longevity. A healthy lifestyle improves energy, sleep, metabolism, mood, immune function, and even appearance.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!-- Nutrition -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Nutrition for Longevity</h5>
      <p>Your food is your fuel—and your medicine. We focus on anti-inflammatory, nutrient-dense meals tailored to your lab work, metabolic type, and personal goals. Interventions may include intermittent fasting, low-glycemic diets, Mediterranean-style eating, or gut-focused protocols.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!-- Movement -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Exercise & Movement</h5>
      <p>Exercise reduces the risk of almost every age-related disease. But not all movement is created equal. We help you implement a balanced plan that includes strength training, aerobic conditioning, mobility, and recovery—designed for your fitness level, hormone profile, and goals like muscle gain or stamina.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!-- Sleep -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Sleep Optimization</h5>
      <p>Poor sleep leads to weight gain, mood swings, brain fog, and accelerated aging. Our lifestyle plans include circadian rhythm alignment, light therapy, sleep hygiene, and natural supplements to restore restorative sleep cycles without dependency on sedatives.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!-- Stress Management -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Stress & Emotional Resilience</h5>
      <p>Chronic stress drives hormonal dysfunction, inflammation, and immune suppression. We teach breathing techniques, digital detox strategies, mindfulness tools, and—when needed—layer in adaptogens and peptides that support nervous system recovery.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!-- Social Health & Purpose -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Connection & Meaning</h5>
      <p>Research shows that social support and life purpose are major predictors of long life. We encourage the cultivation of relationships, creative goals, and service to others as key ingredients to lasting health—because how you live matters just as much as what you take.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!-- Integration -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">Integrated With Your Medical Plan</h5>
      <p>Lifestyle isn’t separate from your care—it is the backbone. Every ABBSI protocol includes lifestyle planning alongside supplements, peptides, and medications. That’s how we create real, lasting change—not temporary relief.</p>
