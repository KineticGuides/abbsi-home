        Chronic stress is one of the most underestimated threats to long-term health and longevity. When left unchecked, it disrupts nearly every major system in the bodyâ€”elevating cortisol levels, impairing sleep, accelerating aging, weakening the immune system, and contributing to conditions like high blood pressure, weight gain, anxiety, and even cognitive decline. Over time, the body loses its ability to recover from everyday challenges, leading to burnout, hormonal imbalances, and increased disease risk. Reducing stress is not a luxuryâ€”itâ€™s a vital component of preventive healthcare. At ABBSI, we take a proactive approach by addressing stress through lifestyle design, nervous system regulation, breathwork, adaptogens, and peptides that support emotional resilience. By restoring calm and balance, patients experience clearer thinking, better sleep, improved mood, and the physiological reset needed to thrive.
