      <h5 class="subheading">What Are Peptides?</h5>
      <p>Peptides are short chains of amino acids—naturally found in the body—that act like messengers, telling cells to turn certain functions on or off. They can promote tissue repair, stimulate hormone production, boost energy, and improve cognitive function, depending on the type used.</p>

    <!-- How They Work -->
    <div class="info-box">
      <h5 class="subheading">How Peptides Work in the Body</h5>
      <p>Each peptide binds to specific receptors on cells, triggering biological effects with targeted precision. Some peptides mimic the body’s natural growth signals, while others modulate inflammation or immune function. Their small size allows them to work quickly and effectively with minimal side effects.</p>
